# bio

Hey! My name's HÃ©ctor! You just stumbled right into my little corner of the internet. 

I'm a student, currently getting his Bachelor's Degree in Data Science at [ITAM](https://www.itam.mx/). I'm also President of the Theatre Company, [Teatro ITAM](https://www.teatroitam.org/). 

Aside from computers and math, I love theatre, videogames (particularly RPGs), and anime.

You can find my full CV [here](cv). Feel free to look into the [blog](blog) for some "fun" opinions on Data Science, Theatre, SWE and Economics =).
